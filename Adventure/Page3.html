    <p>Later that day I started to get bored but wanted to grab a bite. But it was summertime and restaurants were 
    extremly packed. So I decided that while I wait for Shawn I am going take another selfie. If you haven't notice I love 
taking pictures of myself. I have come a long way so I love capturing all my happy moments and this is one. BUT GUESS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER I TOOK THIS HAPPY SELFIE??? SCROLL DOWN FOR MORE </p>

    <p>Capture all the happy moments it life so you can always relive them through your memories.</p>

    <img src="images/IMG_0875.jpg" alt="Second Image">
    <p>Drakes bestfriend and manager DJ walks up behind and say, "Wow! You are beautiful! I hope you are having a good day today. When I turned around to say thank you I was completely shocked and he goes What? Do you know who I am? I shook my head yes and said you are DJ the man behind Drake and OVO.
    He said I see you know your stuff. Then proceed to say, "Let's take a photo so you can remember this moment. I never hopped out my seat and handed off my phone to a stranger passing by. This was the awesome and cool photo they capturd of me and him. And for some reason Drake never came to my mind. I forgot he had a concert on random Monday.</p>
