    <p>Here how my story starts. It was a hot random summer day in the big apple. I decided that I am going to go the city to hang out and take a few pictures because my outfit was cute and it was my first time wearing a short pants. I never do so I was feeling risky wearing it. I am so happy I did. I called two of my friends and they said it was too hot and they didn't want to come out. I didn't blame them because it was EXTREMELY HOT in August. I said ok you guys are missing out but I had no clue how crazy and amazing my day will get. I did call my friend Sean to come hang out with me. You will meet shawn later.</p>
